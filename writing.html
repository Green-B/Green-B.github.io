			<h1>Science communication</h1>
			<p>My science writing began in graduate school, though I had been involved in outreach through demonstrations as an undergrad as well.
			I enjoy finding analogies and metaphors that make technical concepts feel familiar to everyone.</p>
			<p>For my scientific publications, see <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UV2JUxEAAAAJ" target="_blank">my Google Scholar profile</a>.</p>

			<h3>Quantum Tech for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing</h3>
			<p>I wrote this post on quantum enhancements for GPS and atom interferometry for inertial navigation
			as a promotional article for Booz Allen Hamilton, where I worked as a quantum science consultant at the time.
			I separated from the company soon before it was completed, so I am uncredited and my colleagues wrote the article's lead-in.
			My writing begins at the fourth paragraph, opening with "GPS technology stands to be improved…"</p>

			<h3>Everyday Physics, and Your Own Particle Accelerator</h3>
			<p>Most of the public’s exposure to physics comes from either learning Newton’s laws in high school
			or news of massive experiments like the Large Hadron Collider, so most modern physics research goes under the radar.
			Thus, when a friend offered me the chance to write a guest column for the local newspaper,
			I opted to write about a few of the most active subfields in physics and their relevance to the technologies we rely on today.</p>

			<h3>On Empathy</h3>
			<p>As an undergraduate, I survived a brain tumor. The disease and the treatment were invisible from the outside,
			and my family and I contemplated at that time how many others must likewise have undetectable trials and tribulations.
			We have tried to consider this in our interactions going forward.
			As a graduate student I put these thoughts to word in and then adapted them for a radio segment.</p>
