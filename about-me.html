			<h1>About me</h1>
			<h3>...as a scientist</h3>
			<p>I am a physicist and mathematician, or in somewhat informal terms, I like to learn and discover how the world works and to expand my toolkit for solving problems and puzzles continuously. My training in graduate school was in theoretical condensed matter physics, or the art of calculating material properties using quantum mechanics, and I’ve built up expertise in quantum information science, including quantum sensing. These fields have long been of special interest to me because they are particularly tangible and often have clear pathways to practical applications; however, as long as the questions present good mathematical puzzles, I can take interest in a wide range of topics.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>...as a communicator, advocate, and mentor</h3>
			<p>Sharing what I’ve learned as a scientist and mathematician in a way that everyone can understand is nearly as valuable to me as the science itself. The greater role science and technology play in our lives, the more important it is that the average person can understand and appreciate them. Furthermore, sharing helps me to refine and test my understanding – as the saying roughly goes, if you can’t explain it to the average person, then I probably don’t understand it yourself.</p>
			<p>Personal communication is as important to me as science communication, especially mentorship and advocacy. Wherever I have experience, I want to share the strategies that have been helpful for me, whether in seeking and applying to jobs, universities, and fellowships or in research or personal life. I am also interested in using communication as a means to advocate effectively for equity and inclusion.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>...as a hobbyist and creator</h3>
			<p>I have always enjoyed making things in a broad sense, both physically and digitally. Rather than focus on mastering one specific craft, I typically prefer to achieve competency in many so that I can suit my approach to the need at hand rather than seek needs that fit my approach. These range from building this website and interactive science demonstrations to woodcarving and crochet.</p>
			<p>Most recently, I have developed skills in photo and video editing in support of another hobby. These have proven useful for science communication as well, helping me to make better graphics to explain concepts. I find that creative hobbies are an excellent way to explore new skills that can come into play in unexpected ways later, including professionally.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>...as a citizen of the world</h3>
			<p>We are all more alike than we are different, yet there is so much to learn and appreciate from others across the world. As I’ve built connections across boundaries, I have found that the vast majority are as amiable as you or I, regardless of our countries’ positions. If more of us understood this and put our preconceptions aside, the world would surely be a better place, so I consider it doing my part to forge friendships across the world.</p>
			<p>Learning from other cultures can also show us so much that we take for granted in the most basic aspects of life. For a linguistic example, the word order that is crucial to convey meaning in English can be merely optional in languages that use grammatical endings or particles. Broadly speaking, I find cultural exchange to be an incredible source of new concepts and ideas as the most fundamental level.</p>
